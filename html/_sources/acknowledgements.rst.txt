ChatGPT
-------
I used ChatGPT to help me understand the basics of RST and how to identify classes/methods. The prompt given: "In RST for Sphinx, how do I identify class and methods?"

The output of the prompt was: "To document a class, use the .. class:: directive followed by the class name and its description. You can then use :method: directive to document the methods within the class."



Furthermore, I had ChatGPT proofread my Introduction and API sections. The prompt given: "Can you grammar check my RST files for an API document: [api.rst] [introduction.rst]"

The output was: "The subsections of Introduction and API."
